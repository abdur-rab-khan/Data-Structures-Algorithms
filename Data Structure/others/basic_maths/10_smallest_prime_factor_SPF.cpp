    >> 1. Here we use Smallest Prime Factor method to find Prime Numbers. So like in previous query
   based question we use same logic here.
   >> 2. Pre-Computation: But the small changes is instead of using 0 we use smallest prime factor
   at that place.
   >> 3. Finally we divide the query with given smaller factor division perform until it will
   become 1.
    >> Time Complexity is: o(N log log N) + (Q + logâ‚‚ N)
    >> Space Complexity is: o(N)

    Example:-
        For: 12 --> | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
        >> Step 1: Check is number is prime if yes that find there smaller prime factors. once the
   prime allocated smaller prime factor we can't change it.
        >> | 2 | 3 | 4 = 2 | 5 | 6 = 2 | 7 | 8 = 2| 9 | 10 = 2 | 11 | 12 = 2 |
        --> | 2 | 3 | 4 = 2 | 5 | 6 = 2 | 7 | 8 = 2 | 9 = 3 | 10 = 2 | 11 | 12 = 2 |

        >> 12 = 2 | 12
            6 = 2 | 6
                3 | 3
                  | 1

            --> Prime factors are 2, 2, 3
