# Data Structure and Algorithms

- **DSA** ( Data Structure and Algorithms) is a study of organizing data using data structures such as **Arrow**, **Stack**, **Queues** and **Trees**.
- Algorithms are the procedures that will perform on these **data structures** such as **Sorting**, **Searching**, **Hashing**.

## Time Complexity

- To analyze algorithm, We actually see the growth of time or space taken in terms of input size.
