## What actually is GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

> The Greatest Common Division (GCD) is also know as High Common Factor (HCF) is the greatest number that divides a set of numbers without leaving any reminders.

### Usages of GCD

- Maximum 2 Groups can be formed with each having 2 Stars and 3 Moons.

  - **Result:**  GCD of 4 Stars and 6 Moons will be 2. Which means we can divide them into two
groups.

- Find the Maximum Number of Groups to Equally Distribute 6 Candies and 9 Chocolates.

  - **Result:** GCD of 6 Candies and 9 Chocolates will be 3.

## Method of Find GCD

- There are multiple method to find GCD:
  1. **Prime Factorization method**
  2. **Euclid's Division Algorithm**
  3. **Binary GCD Algorithm**

### 1. Euclid's Division Algorithm

> Euclid's Division Algorithm, It is used to find the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two integers. In this algorithm, We repeatedly divide and find remainders until remainder becomes zero.
