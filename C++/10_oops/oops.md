# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) in C++
> In Object Oriented Programming we use real world entities such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism to implement the program. The main of `oops` is to bind together the data and function that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

## Class
> Classes are the building block of Object Oriented Programming language they are used to build the blueprint representing group of object. It is a `used-defined` data type which share common properties (`data`) and behavior (`member function`). And we are able to change there [access modifier](#encapsulation).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    // data
   public:
    string name;
    int age;
    int roll_no;
    float cgpa;

    // member functions
    void getStudentInfo() {
        cout << "Name " << name << endl;
        cout << "Age " << age << endl;
        cout << "Roll No " << roll_no << endl;
        cout << "CGPA " << cgpa << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1;

    s1.name = "Abdur Rab Khan";
    s1.age = 21;
    s1.roll_no = 32;
    s1.cgpa = 8.70;

    s1.getStudentInfo();

    return 0;
}
```

## Object
> Objects are instances of a class that allow us to access and utilize the characteristics and behaviors defined in the class. While a class is just a blueprint or concept, an object is the actual entity created from that blueprint. In C++, we cannot use the properties (data members) or behaviors (member functions) defined in a class unless we create an object of that class.

  When class is defined there is no memory allocated but when it is (initialized) than memory is allocated.

```cpp
// Example of creating objects
int main() {
    // Creating two different objects of Student class
    Student s1;  // First object
    Student s2;  // Second object
    
    // Initializing first object
    s1.name = "Abdur Rab Khan";
    s1.age = 21;
    
    // Initializing second object
    s2.name = "John Doe";
    s2.age = 20;
    
    // Now we can use member functions through these objects
    s1.getStudentInfo();
    s2.getStudentInfo();
    
    return 0;
}
```
## Encapsulation
> Encapsulation is a concept in object-oriented programming that refers to wrapping data and related functions into a single unit, usually a class. In C++, we achieve encapsulation using access modifiers such as `private`, `public`, and `protected`. These modifiers help protect the internal state of an object by preventing unauthorized access or modification from outside the class.

* ### Access Modifier
    > In C++, access modifiers allow a class to control the visibility of its members. This helps restrict direct access from outside the class, a concept known as data hiding.
    * Types of **access modifier.**
        1. [`public`](#public)
        2. [`private`](#private)
        3. [`protected`](#protected)

    1. #### `public`
        > In C++, `public` access modifier allows class members to  be accessed from outside the class.

        ```cpp
        #include<iostream>
        using namespace std;

        class A{
            int num1 = 10;
            int num2 = 10;

            public:
            int getSum(){
                return num1 + num2;
            }
        }

        int main(){
            A a1;

            cout << "Sum of num1 and num2 " << s1.getSum() << endl; // 20

            cout << a1.num1 << endl; // ‚ö†Ô∏è We can't access it because it is private
            cout << a1.num2 << endl;
            return 0;
        }
        ```

    2. #### `private`
        > In C++, `private` access modifier restricts class members to be accessed from outside the class. It also restricts from subclass also. The makes protected a good choice when we want to hide some critical(related to security or credential) information.

        ```cpp
        // See Public Example
        ```
    3. #### `protected`
       > In C++, `protected` access modifiers are different from `private` and `public`. It restricts access class members from outside the class but allows access from subclass. This makes protected a good choice when we want to allow derived classes to access certain members, while still keeping them hidden from the outside world. Unlike private members, which are completely inaccessible outside the class, protected members are available to any class that inherits from the base class. 
       ```cpp
        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        
        class A {
        protected:
            string password;
        
        public:
            void setPassword(string pass) { password = pass; }
        };
        
        class B : public A {
            string name = "Abdur Rab Khan";
            int age = 21;
        
            bool isCorrectPass() {
                string pass;
                cout << "Enter pass ";
                getline(cin, pass);
        
                return password == pass;
            }
        
        public:
        
            void printMyInfo() {
                bool isCorrect = isCorrectPass();
        
                if (isCorrect) {
                    cout << "Name " << name << endl;
                    cout << "Age " << age << endl;
                } else {
                    cout << "Password is incorrect" << endl;
                }
            }
        };
        
        int main() {
            B p1;
        
            p1.setPassword("abdurrab123");
        
            // cout << p1.password; ‚ö†Ô∏è We can't access it.
        
            p1.printMyInfo();
            return 0;
        }
       ```
## Abstraction
>Abstraction in C++ refers to hiding complex mechanisms and exposing only the essential features to the outside world. we can implement using `access modifier`.
For example, when a person drives a car and presses the accelerator, they do not need to understand the internal mechanisms that increase the speed.  

* Types of abstraction
    1. **Data Abstraction**: Show only required information about the data.
    2. **Control Abstraction**: Show only required information about the implementation.

class Vehicle
{
  private:
          void piston()
        {
            cout<<"4 piston\n";
        }

        void manWhoMade()
        {
            cout<<"Markus Librette\n";
        }
    public:
        void company()
        {
            cout<<"GFG\n";
        }
        void model()
        {
            cout<<"SIMPLE\n";
        }
        void color()
        {
            cout<<"Red/GREEN/Silver\n";
        }
        void cost()
        {
            cout<<"Rs. 60000 to 900000\n";
        }
        void oil()
        {
            cout<<"PETROL\n";
        }
};
int main()
{
    
    Vehicle obj;
    obj.company();
    obj.model();
    obj.color();
    obj.cost();
    obj.oil();
}
```

## Polymorphism
> The term **polymorphism** means having many forms. In C++ polymorphism is concept that can be applied on `function` and `operator`. A single function can work differently in different situations. similarly `operator` can work differently when used in different context.

* Types of **Polymorphism**
    1. [Compile time **Polymorphism**](#1-compile-time-polymorphism)
    2. [Run time **Polymorphism**](#2-run-time-polymorphism)
    
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
    
    A[**Polymorphism**] --> B[Compile Time]
    A --> C[Run time]
    B --> E[Function Overloading]
    B --> F[Function Overriding]
    C --> G[Virtual Function]
    ```
    
    ### 1. Compile Time Polymorphism
    > In Compiler time polymorphism compiler can determine how the function or operator will work depending on the context. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. It is also know as **early binding**.
    
    1. **Function Overloading**
        > Function Overloading is a feature in `OOPS`. Such function can work differently for different parameter. Function can be overload by changing number of `argument` or type of `argument`.
        ```cpp
        #include<iostream>
        using namespace std;

        class Math{
            public:
            
            // Work we call like this Math.add(1,2)
            int add(int a,int b){
                return a + b;
            }

            // Work we call like this Math.add(1,2,3)
            int add(int a, int b, int c){
                return a + b + c;
            }

            // Work we call like this Math.add(1.5,2.6)
            int add(float a, float b){
                return a + b;
            }

            // Work we call like this Math.add(1.5,1.5,1.5)
            int add(float a, float b, float c){
                return a + b + b;
            }
        }
        ```
    2. **Operator Overloading**
        > Operator Overloading in C++ is special meaning for particular data type, We can change the working mechanism of Operator based upon context.

        ```cpp
            #include <iostream>
            using namespace std;
            
            class Complex {
            public:
                int real, imag;
                
                Complex(int r, int i) :
                real(r), imag(i) {}
            
                // Overloading the '+' operator
                Complex operator+(const Complex& obj) {
                    return Complex(real + obj.real,
                    imag + obj.imag);
                }
            };
            
            int main() {
                Complex c1(10, 5), c2(2, 4);
                
                // Adding c1 and c2 using + operator
                Complex c3 = c1 + c2;  
                cout << c3.real << " + i" << c3.imag;
                return 0;
            }
        ```
